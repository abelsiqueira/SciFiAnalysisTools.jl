"""
    location_bin_center(id)

Calculates the center of the bin (x, y) corresponding to a given channel ID in the detector's
coordinate system.

# Arguments
- `id`: A `NamedTuple` or object with attributes `_module`, `_quarter`, `_station`, `_layer`,
  `_mat`, and `_sipm`, representing the components of the channel ID.

# Details
- `x` is computed by determining the coarse position based on the module and quarter, and then
  refining it with the mat and SiPM information.
- `y` is computed by combining the station and layer information with the quarter's contribution.
